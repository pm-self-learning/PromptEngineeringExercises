# Exercise: Improve Code Security Using GitHub Copilot Chat

## Overview
In this exercise, you will use GitHub Copilot Chat to generate suggestions that help improve code security in a sample application. The focus will be on enhancing authentication, data protection, secure error handling, and compliance with security standards.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this exercise, ensure you have the following tools and resources installed:
- Visual Studio Code
- The C# Dev Kit extension for Visual Studio Code
- GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the Sample Application
1. Open the `APL2007M5BankAccount-Security` project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Familiarize yourself with the `Program.cs` and `BankAccount.cs` files under the `BankAccountClass` project.
3. Build and run the project to ensure it works as expected:
   - Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following command:
   ```bash
   cd BankAccountClass
   dotnet run
   ```
   - The application should generate random bank account details and perform basic operations like crediting, debiting, and transferring funds.
   - The output should display the account details and the results of the operations.

### 2. Identify Areas for Improvement
1. Review the following methods in the `BankAccount.cs` file:
   - `Credit`
   - `Debit`
   - `Transfer`
   - `CalculateInterest`
2. Consider aspects such as authentication, data protection, and secure error handling.

### 3. Use GitHub Copilot Chat to Generate Suggestions
1. Open the Chat view in `Ask` mode in Visual Studio Code.
2. Attach the `BankAccount.cs` file to the Chat context.
3. Use the following prompt to generate suggestions:
   - "`@workspace` How can I improve authentication and data protection in the `BankAccount` class?"
4. Review the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot Chat.
5. Implement updates that enhance code security, such as:
   - Adding authentication mechanisms.
   - Encrypting sensitive data.
   - Avoiding hardcoded passwords.

### 4. Secure Exception Handling
1. Open the Chat view in `Ask` mode in Visual Studio Code.
2. Attach the `Program.cs` file to the Chat context.
3. Use the following prompt to generate suggestions:
   - "`@workspace` How can I implement secure exception handling in the `Program.cs` file?"
4. Review the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot Chat.
5. Implement updates that enhance secure exception handling, such as:
   - Catching specific exceptions instead of generic ones.
   - Logging errors securely.

### 6. Iterate and Refine
1. Use additional prompts to explore further improvements.
2. Repeat the process of reviewing, implementing, and testing updates.

   Consider the following additional prompts:
    - "`@workspace` How can I avoid future security vulnerabilities in the `Program.cs` file?"
    - "`@workspace` How can I improve compliance with security standards in the `BankAccount` class?"

3. Implement updates that enhance code security, such as:
   - Refactoring methods to handle sensitive data securely.
   - Improving authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Ensuring compliance with security standards and regulations.

### Notes
- The suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot Chat are not exhaustive. Use your judgment and expertise to evaluate and implement them.
- Consider your workplace's coding standards and policies when choosing which updates to implement.
- Ensure thorough code reviews and testing to maintain high-quality code.
