# Improving Code Quality with GitHub Copilot

## Overview
Code quality refers to the readability, maintainability, and modularity of the codebase. Improving code quality is essential for creating a well-structured, manageable, and extensible codebase.

## Factors to improve Code Quality

1. **Refactor Code**:
   - Break down large methods into smaller, reusable methods.
   - Follow the principle of Separation of Concerns.

2. **Enhance Readability**:
   - Use meaningful variable names.
   - Add comments to explain complex logic.
   - Use the `var` keyword for cleaner code when the type is obvious.

3. **Reduce Complexity**:
   - Extract repeated code into separate methods.
   - Use constants for magic numbers to improve clarity.

4. **Improve Modularity**:
   - Organize code into smaller, reusable components.
   - Ensure methods have a single responsibility.

5. **Test and Validate**:
   - Build and run the solution after refactoring to ensure no errors are introduced.
